(i) Sort all elements by Insertion-sort and return the 𝑘’th element in the list,

(ii) Sort all elements by Merge-sort and return the 𝑘’th element in the list,

(iii) Sort all elements by Quick-sort and return the 𝑘’th element in the list. While partitioning choose the pivot element as the first element in an array.

(iv) Apply partial selection-sort, i.e. find the minimum element 𝑘 times to find the 𝑘’th smallest element.

(v) Apply partial heap-sort, i.e. store all elements in a max-heap and apply 𝑛−𝑘 times max removal. Return the max element in the root,

(vi) Not sort the list, but apply quick select algorithm, which is based on array partitioning, as described in the class. While partitioning, choose the pivot element as the first element in an array,

(vii) Apply quick select algorithm, but this time use median-of-three pivot selection1
